		GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- It was beyond ugly for most of the day for Florida's offense, but when everything was on the line, the Gators turned to their kicker.

The position that has given Florida so many problems this season saved the Gators' SEC Eastern Division title hopes when the much-maligned Austin Hardin nailed a 43-yard field goal with 2:22 remaining in No. 10 Florida's 9-7 win over Vanderbilt.

Florida (8-1, 6-1 SEC) totaled six possessions that started in Vanderbilt territory, yet came away with just nine points and 256 total yards.</div>
